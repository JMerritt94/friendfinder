# friendfinder

This was the first full stack app I made. In this app I used ES6 and Express to create an app that essentially works as a friend finding app. You fill out the survey,
and when you complete the survey it adds your data to an API. Then your data is compared to the data that is hardcoded into the API to see who would be the best match for you based on your answers.
For my front end I used fontawesome and bootstrap.
